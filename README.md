# game_with_card_system

This a game that contains a reusable system, contained within the `card_system` folder, for making other card-based games. More info about the card system can be found on its folder and [readme file](card_system/README.md).

Some thoughts on the game's design and approach are below, and there's also [a separate log here](docs/log.md).
